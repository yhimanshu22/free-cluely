## Sponsored by Recall AI - API for desktop recording
If you’re looking for a hosted desktop recording API, consider checking out [Recall.ai](https://www.recall.ai/product/desktop-recording-sdk?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=prat011-free-cluely), an API that records Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, in-person meetings, and more.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
- Git installed on your computer  
- **Either** a Gemini API key (get it from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))
- **Or** Ollama installed locally for private LLM usage (recommended for privacy)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd free-cluely
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# If you encounter Sharp/Python build errors, use this:
SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install --ignore-scripts
npm rebuild sharp

# Or for normal installation:
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root folder
   
   **For Gemini (Cloud AI):**
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **For Ollama (Local/Private AI):**
   ```env
   USE_OLLAMA=true
   OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2
   OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
   ```
   
   - Save the file

### Running the App

#### Method 1: Development Mode (Recommended for first run)
1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This command automatically:
- Starts the Vite dev server on port 5180
- Waits for the server to be ready
- Launches the Electron app

#### Method 2: Production Build
```bash
npm run dist
```
The built app will be in the `release` folder.
