The built app will be in the `release` folder.

### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Closing the App**: 
   - Press `Cmd + Q` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Q` (Windows/Linux) to quit
   - Or use Activity Monitor/Task Manager to close `Interview Coder`
   - The X button currently doesn't work (known issue)

2. **If the app doesn't start**:
   - Make sure no other app is using port 5180
   - Try killing existing processes:
     ```bash
     # Find processes using port 5180
     lsof -i :5180
     # Kill them (replace [PID] with the process ID)
     kill [PID]
     ```

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + B`: Toggle window visibility
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + H`: Take screenshot
   - 'Cmd/Enter': Get solution
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow Keys`: Move window

### Troubleshooting

Note: Working to add proper support to windows and ubuntu

If you see errors:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `package-lock.json`
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Try running the app again using Method 1
